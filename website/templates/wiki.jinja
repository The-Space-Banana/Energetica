  <h2>Introduction to Energetica</h2>
  <p>
    Energetica is a massive multiplayer online game where players are tasked with managing the electricity generation of
    their community. Beginning with basic technology like a rudimentary steam engine, players progress towards more
    advanced options such as photovoltaics and nuclear reactors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Continuous vigilance over production is essential to ensure a consistent and adequate supply of electricity to 
    support various industrial needs. Collaboration with other players to establish a network for trading electricity 
    and advancing technological developments is crucial.
  </p>
  <p>
    Effective management of fossil fuels and careful monitoring of emissions are imperative, as consequences may arise 
    from negligence in these areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    This wiki serves as a comprehensive documentation of all the mechanics within the game. While not a prerequisite 
    before gameplay, referencing specific chapters within this wiki can aid in making informed decisions during 
    gameplay.

  <h2 id="Map">The Map</h2>
  <p>
    Upon creating an account, your initial task is to select a location on the map. It's crucial to note that this 
    choice is <strong>permanent</strong>; there won't be any opportunity to expand or alter your chosen tile. Choose 
    wisely.
  </p>
  <p>
    The map consists of a hexagonal grid comprising 331 tiles, visualized on the home screen.
  </p>
  <p>
    The distance between your location and another player's tile directly impacts resource shipment times when engaging 
    in trade. For more insights, refer to the <a href="#Resource_Market">resource market</a> section.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each tile offers a specific assortment of resourcesâ€”seven distinct resources categorized into renewable and fossil 
    fuel types:
  </p>

  <h3 id="Renewable_resources">Renewable resources:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Solar:</strong> The solar potential is given in W/mÂ², indicating the maximal irradiance acievable at this 
      latitiude. The higher this maximum irradiance, the higher will be the power production of PV and CSP plants.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Wind:</strong> The wind potential is given in km/h, indicating the average wind speed at this tile. Refer 
      to <a href="#Wind_Power_Generation">wind power generation</a> for details on how it affects the generation of 
      windmills and wind turbines.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Hydro:</strong> Presented as a number from 0 to 5, the hydro potential signifies the number of suitable 
      locations available for building watermills and water dams. Note that each of the three hydropower plants is 
      considerated independently for the hydro potential; thus, smaller structures dont need to be dismantled to make 
      room for larger ones. Pumped hydro facilities are not affected by hydro potential.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 id="Fossil_fuels">Fossil fuels:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Coal, Oil, Gas, and Uranium:</strong> These indicate the quantity of each resource stored underground on
      a specific tile. Extraction facilities allow you to extract these resources. For detailed procedures, consult the
      <a href="#Extraction_Facilities">extraction facilities</a> section.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="Power_Facilities">Power Facilities</h2>
  <p>
    Power facilities are integral for electricity generation within the game. Upon starting, you begin with a single
    steam engine. Initially, only the steam engine, watermill, and windmill are available. However, researching
    technologies will unlock additional power facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Power facilities within Energetica are classified into five distinct categories, each offering different
    characteristics and functionalities. Understanding these categories is crucial for strategic decision-making when
    managing electricity generation.
  </p>
  <h4>Fossil Fuel Family</h4>
  <p>This category includes various power facilities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Steam engine</li>
    <li>Coal burner &ensp;<span class="txt_pine">(Coal)</span></li>
    <li>Oil burner  &ensp;<span class="txt_pine">(Oil)</span></li>
    <li>Gas burner &ensp;<span class="txt_pine">(Gas)</span></li>
    <li>Combined cycle &ensp;<span class="txt_pine">(Gas + Coal)</span></li>
    <li>Nuclear reactor &ensp;<span class="txt_pine">(Uranium)</span></li>
    <li>Gen4 Nuclear &ensp;<span class="txt_pine">(Uranium)</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>These plants are controllable, emit CO2, and require fuel for operation (except for the steam engine).</p>
  <h4>Wind Family</h4>
  <p>The wind family consists of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Windmill</li>
    <li>Onshore wind turbine</li>
    <li>Offshore wind turbine</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These facilities are non-controllable, do not emit pollutants during operation, and their power output varies based 
    on windconditions.
  </p>
  <h4>Water Family</h4>
  <p>Facilities in this category include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Watermill</li>
    <li>Small water dam</li>
    <li>Large water dam</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Similar to wind facilities, these are non-controllable, emission-free during operation, and their output varies 
    during the year based on river discharge rates.
  </p>
  <h4>Solar Family</h4>
  <p>The solar family comprises:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Concentrated solar power</li>
    <li>Photovoltaics</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These facilities are also non-controllable, emission-free during operation, and their output varies based on solar 
    irradiance levels.
  </p>
  <h3 id="Power_Generation_of_Renewable_Facilities">Power Generation of Renewable Facilities</h3>
  <p>
    Renewable power generation is non-controllable, meaning their power output is determined by specific calculations,
    regardless of the demand. Any surplus generation needs to be either stored or dumped.
  </p>
  <h4 id="Wind_Power_Generation">Wind Power Generation</h4>
  <p>
    The power generated by wind facilities is influenced by the number of wind power facilities, the average wind speed,
    and the current wind speed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Real-life wind speed data from ZÃ¼rich with a 15-minute delay is utilized. The location-specific wind speed on a
    tile is calculated as follows: \(ws_{loc} = ws_{Ã¼tli} \times \sqrt{\frac{ws_{avr} }{50km/h} }\) with \(ws_{Ã¼tli}\) 
    beeing the wind speed mesured at Uetliberg and \(ws_{avr}\) the average wind speed specific to the players tile.
  </p>
  <p>
    The power generated by wind turbines is calculated using a characteristic function:
  </p>
  <!-- Placeholder for Wind Turbine Characteristic Curve Graph -->
  <div class="graph-container">
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/wiki/char_func_wind.jpg') }}"
         alt="Characteristic curve of wind turbine">
  </div>
  <p>Formula for total power generation of wind facilty type i:</p>
  <p>\(P_i = cf(ws_{Ã¼tli} \times \sqrt{\frac{ ws_{avr} }{ 50km/h } }) \times maxP_i \times n_i \)</p>
  <p>
    where \(cf()\) is the characteristic function shown in the graph, \(ws_{Ã¼tli}\) is the current wind speed (live
    ZÃ¼rich) in km/h, \(ws_{avr}\) is the average wind speed on the players tile, \(maxP_i\) is the max power generation given for the
    facility type i and \(n_i\) is the number of facilities of type i owned by the player.
  </p>
  <h4>Solar Power Generation</h4>
  <p>
    Solar power generation depends on the number of solar power facilities, the tile irradiance, and the current
    irradiance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Real-life irradiance data from ZÃ¼rich with a 15-minute delay is considered. The location-specific irradiance is
    calculated as: \(irr_{loc} = irr_{Ã¼tli} \times \frac{ irr_{tile} }{1000W/mÂ²} \) with \(irr_{Ã¼tli}\) beeing the 
    irradiance mesured at Uetliberg and \(irr_{tile}\) the maximal irradiance specific to the players tile.
  </p>
  <p>Formula for total power generation of solar facilty type i:</p>
  <p>\(P_i = \frac{ irr_{Ã¼tli} }{875W/mÂ²} \times \frac{ irr_{tile} }{1000W/mÂ²} \times maxP_i \times n_i \)</p>
  <p>
    where \(irr_{Ã¼tli}\) is the current irradiance (live ZÃ¼rich) in W/mÂ², \(irr_{tile}\) is the max solar iradiance on the players
    tile, \(875 W/mÂ²\)  is the maximal theoretical irradiance in ZÃ¼rich, \(maxP_i\) is the max power generation of the
    facility type i and \(n_i\) is the number of facilities of type i owned by the player.
  </p>
  <h4>Hydropower Generation</h4>
  <p>
    Hydropower generation fluctuates with the change in river discharge rates, following seasonal patterns within the
    game's timeline.
  </p>
  <!-- Placeholder for Seasonal Variation of River Discharge Graph -->
  <div class="graph-container">
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/wiki/seasonal_variation_rivers.jpg') }}"
         alt="Seasonal variataions of river discharges">
  </div>
  <p>Formula for total power generation of hydropower facilty type i:</p>
  <p>\(P_i = sv(t) \times maxP_i \times n_i \)</p>
  <p>
    where \(sv()\) is the seasonal variation shown in the graph, \(t\) is the in-game date (in-game months have only 7 days), \(maxP_i\) is the max power
    generation of the facility type i and \(n_i\) is the number of facilities of type i owned by the player.
  </p>
  <h3 id="Power_Generation_of_Controllable_Plants">Power Generation of Controllable Plants</h3>
  <p>
    Controllable plant power generation must adhere to the ramping constraints of each plant from one minute to the
    next. The ramping speed, expressed in W/min, applies both to ramping up and down.
  </p>
  <p>
    For instance, a controllable plant with a ramping speed of 10 kW/min, generating 100 kW, can vary its output
    between 90 and 110 kW in the following minute. Unused minimal power may need to be dumped to satisfy the ramping down
    constraint.
  </p>
  <p>
    The order of priority in withch the controllable facilities are used can be adjusted by the player. See 
    <a href="#Prioritazation_of_Facilities">Prioritazation of Facilities</a> for details.
  </p>
  <h4>Use of Resources</h4>
  <p>Except for the steam engine, controllable power plants consume resources/fuel for operation.</p>
  <p>
    The fuel usage is measured in kg/MWh, indicating that fuel consumption is proportionate to the electricity
    generated. In cases where a plant lacks sufficient fuel to produce a specific amount of electricity, it will
    maximize its production using available fuel stocks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thermodynamics influences plant efficiency, decreasing fuel consumption per unit of energy.
  </p>
  <h4>CO2 Emissions</h4>
  <p>
    CO2 emissions are calculated based on the fuel usage of plants and are expressed in kg/MWh. Similar to fuel
    consumption, CO2 production correlates with the amount of power generated. CO2 emissions affect the shared
    atmosphere among all players, influencing the game's climate. Refer to <a href="#climate_change_impacts">climate change impact</a> for more details.
  </p>
  <h3 id="O&M_costs">Operation and Maintenance Cost</h3>
  <p>
    Each power facility in the game incurs operational and maintenance costs. For renewable facilities, these costs are
    fixed, while for controllable plants, there is both a fixed and a variable component. The fixed costs represent 20%
    of the total O&M costs, while the variable costs, dependent on the power output of the plant, constitute the 
    remaining 80%. Nuclear facilities, such as the Nuclear Reactor and Gen4 Nuclear, differ in that they have a fixed 
    cost fraction of 50%. The O&M costs provided for each facility in the Power facilities page are based on 100% power 
    output.
  </p>
  <h3 id="Construction_of_a_Plant">Construction of a Plant</h3>
  <p>If you choose to construct a new power plant, it will require various resources:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Price: The cost to initiate construction</li>
    <li>Duration: The time required for completion</li>
    <li>Energy need: Electricity required during construction, distributed evenly over the duration</li>
    <li>Emissions: CO2 emitted during construction, distributed over the construction period</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Construction projects are undertaken by construction workers. Each worker can focus on a single construction at a 
    time. Construction projects can be paused, cancelled, and reordered. If a construction is immediately cancelled, 80% 
    of the facility's price will be refunded, with a proportionaly decreasing refund as construction progresses. Upon completing a 
    construction, a worker will automatically move on to the next project in the list, if available.
  </p>
  <p>If the energy demand for constructions isn't met, it is paused.</p>
  <p>
    Researching <a href="{{ url_for('views.technology', _anchor='Building Technology') }}">building technology</a> will unlock additional construction workers and increase the speed of construction projects.
  </p>
  <h2 id="Storage_Facilities">Storage Facilities</h2>
  <p>
    Storage facilities play a crucial role in storing energy within Energetica. Initially, only the small water dam is
    accessible, but as you research technologies, other storage facilities can be unlocked. Despite working on the same
    principle, each storage facility possesses unique characteristics:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Storage Capacity:</strong> Maximum amount of stored energy.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Max Generation:</strong> Maximum electricity generation and usage for charging. Determines the maximum
      charge and discharge speed of the storage facilities.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Efficiency:</strong> Round trip efficiency of the storage plant. Efficiency losses occur during both
      charging and discharging. For instance, if the roundtrip efficiency is 0.81, the charging and discharging
      efficiencies would be sqrt(0.81) = 0.9 (10% loss during charging and 10% more during discharging). Improvements in
      efficiency are possible through certain technologies.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ramping Speed:</strong> Defines the maximum rate of change for charging and discharging. For further
      information, refer to the <a href="#Power_Generation_of_Controllable_Plants">controllable plant power
      generation</a> section.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The construction process for a storage facility mirrors that of power facilities, as described in the <a href="#Construction_of_a_Plant">construction of a plant</a> section.
  </p>
  <h2 id="Extraction_Facilities">Extraction Facilities</h2>
  <p>
    Extraction plants play a pivotal role in acquiring fossil resources within Energetica. Each of the four natural
    resources (Coal, Oil, Gas, and Uranium) has a dedicated extraction plant. Unlocking these plants requires different
    levels of Mineral Extraction technology.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Power Consumption:</strong> Maximum power consumption of the facility. This consumption is proportional to
      the amount of resources extracted. When an extraction facility is inactive, it doesn't consume any power.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Resource Production:</strong> Extraction speed of one facility measured in tons per hour. The extraction speed is
      influenced by the extraction rate, available resources, and the level of Mineral Extraction.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>CO2 Emissions:</strong> Amount of CO2 emitted during resource extraction. Emissions are proportional to
      the resource production and measured in tons of CO2 per ton of extracted resource.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Formula for extraction speed of natural resource i:</p>
  <p>\(es_i = er_i \times q_i \times 1.4^{ME} \times n_{ef,i} \)</p>
  <p>
    where \(es\) is the extraction speed in tons/h, \(er\) is the extraction rate in h\(^{-1}\), \(q_i\) is the amount of the
    resource i in the ground on the player's tile, \(ME\) is the level of the technology <a href="{{ url_for('views.technology', _anchor='Mineral extraction') }}">mineral extraction</a>, and \(n_{ef,i}\) is the number of extraction
    facilities for the resource i owned by the player. Extraction rates are fixed and determine the fraction of underground resources extractable per hour by one
    facility. They are given in the following table :
  </p>
  <div class="flex-col">
    <table class="table bone txt_center">
      <tr>
        <th class="padding">Resource</th>
        <th class="padding">Extraction Rate</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Coal</td>
        <td>{{ (const_data.coal_mine.extraction_rate*100) | round(4) }}% /h</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Oil</td>
        <td>{{ (const_data.oil_field.extraction_rate*100) | round(4) }}% /h</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Gas</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Uranium</td>
        <td>{{ (const_data.uranium_mine.extraction_rate*100) | round(4) }}% /h</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>
    Resources extracted from these plants are stored in the <a href="#The_Warehouse">warehouse</a>. Should the
    warehouse reach full capacity, extraction plants cease operation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The construction process for an extraction plant aligns with that of power facilities, detailed in the <a href="#Construction_of_a_Plant">construction of a plant</a> section.
  </p>
  <h2 id="Functional_Facilities">Functional Facilities</h2>
  <p>
    Functional facilities in Energetica are distinct from power, storage, and extraction facilities as they operate on
    a level-based system. Each upgrade to a higher level incurs increasing costs in terms of money, time, and energy.
    There are four unique functional facilities:
  </p>
  <p>
    The construction process for functional facilities shares similarities with power facilities (<a href="#Construction_of_a_Plant">Construction of a plant</a>). 
    However, the leveling up of a single facility multiple times cannot be parallelized. 
  </p>
  <h3>The Industry</h3>
  <p>
    The Industry serves as a central element, initially starting at level 1. It generates revenue by consuming
    electricity. With each level upgrade, revenue increase by {{ ((const_data.industry["income factor"]-1)*100) | round | int }}% 
    and electricity demand increases by {{ ((const_data.industry["power factor"]-1)*100) | round | int }}%. It is worth 
    noting that because of these rates, the industries economic efficiency (in coin/MWh) is decreasing with higher levels of industry.
    Revenues and power demand gradually increase during the upgrade duration.
  </p>
  <p>
    The electricity demand of the industry fluctuates daily and yearly, following specific cycles represented in the following graphs.
    Energy demand is calculated based on these factors as follows :
  </p>
  <p>\( D = D_{base} \times dv(t) \times sv(t) \)</p>
  <p>
    with \(D_{base}\) the base demand as indicated on the page <a href="{{ url_for('views.functional_facilities') }}">Functional
    facilities</a>, \(dv()\) the daily variations shown in the following graph, \(sv()\) the seasonal variations shown
    in the following graph and \(t\) the in-game date and time (in-game months have only 7 days).
  </p>
  <div class="graph-container">

         src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/wiki/seasonal_variation_industry.jpg') }}"
         alt="Seasonal variation of the industry demand">
  </div>
  <p>If the industry's demand isn't met, it is leveled down to decrease demand.</p>
  <h3 id="The_Laboratory">The Laboratory</h3>
  <p>
    The laboratory is crucial for researching technologies. Different technology levels require corresponding
    laboratory levels. It also enhances research speed by {{ ((1-const_data.laboratory["time factor"])*100) | round | int }}% 
    and for every 3rd upgrade, a new lab worker is unlocked.
  </p>
  <h3 id="The_Warehouse">The Warehouse</h3>
  <p>
    The warehouse is essential for storing natural resources. Each level increment increases the maximum storage
    capacity by {{ ((const_data.warehouse["capacity factor"]-1)*100) | round | int }}% for all resources. The following 
    table defines the initial storage capacities at level 1.
    <div class="flex-col">
    <table class="table bone txt_center">
      <tr>
        <th class="padding">Resource</th>

        <td>300 tons</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Gas</td>
        <td>1'000 tons</td>
      </tr>

  <h3>Carbon Capture</h3>
  <p>
    Not implemented yet ...
    {# Carbon capture facility consumes electricity to extract CO2 from the atmosphere and store it underground. Higher
    levels increase electricity consumption and CO2 absorption rate. #}
  </p>

  <h2 id="Technology">Technology</h2>
  <p>
    Technological advancements in Energetica are made possible through research conducted at the <a href="#The_Laboratory">laboratory</a>. These technologies offer improvements to specific aspects of your
    production within the game. Each technology has a unique effect tailored to a particular set of facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Researching technologies involves electricity consumption without direct CO2 emissions. The technology research is 
    carried out by the lab workers and it follows the same principle as the constructions with the construction workers 
    (<a href="#Construction_of_a_Plant">Construction of a plant</a>). Consecutive upgrades of the same technology are 
    not parallelizable.
  </p>

  <h2 id="Prioritization_of_Facilities">Prioritization of Facilities</h2>
  <p>
    If you are part of a Network, facility prioritization for generation and consumption is determined by market logic. 
    See <a href="#Network">Network</a> for details.
  </p>
  <p>
    Otherwise, if you're not part of a Network, generation and consumption priorities are managed via an interactive 
    list on the <a href="{{ url_for('views.home') }}">home page</a>. This list contains all relevant facilities and 
    processes involved in electricity generation or consumption. Note that storage plants are listed twice, once as 
    generators and once as consumers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The list operates in two directions. Energy generation is prioritized from top to bottom, meaning facilities at the 
    top have higher priority for power generation. Conversely, power consumption is prioritized from bottom to top, with 
    components at the bottom having higher satisfaction priority. Additionally, a generation facility in the list only 
    provides power to consumption components listed below it, and vice versa for consumption components, that only 
    accept power form failites listed above them. Renewable facilities remain fixed in the list as their output is 
    non-controllable and must be used with the highest priority.

    For example, in the above list, the coal burner and small pumped hydro (discharge) are positioned after the demand 
    component for constructions. Consequently, these facilities will never be used to generate power for constructions. 
    If the power supplied by the Watermill and steam engine is insufficient to meet the needs of Industry and 
    constructions, ongoing constructions will be paused, even if there is available capacity from the coal burner or small 
    pumped hydro. However, if the power provided by the windmill and steam engine isn't enough for Industry alone, the 
    coal burner will begin generating, possibly followed by the small pumped hydro, since they are listed before 
    Industry. A generation facility placed at the very end of the list will never be used.

  <h2 id="Network">Network</h2>
  <p>
    In Energetica, players initially operate independently, generating precisely what they need. However, they have the
    option to join or create a network with other players, facilitating electricity trading and potentially enhancing
    supply security.
  </p>
  <p>Within the <a href="{{ url_for('views.network') }}">network page</a>, three tables enable players to set buying and selling prices (only it they are part of a Network):</p>
  <h4>Demand Prices</h4>
  <p>
    The first table is to set maximum buying prices for electricity components within your demand:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Industry</li>
    <li>Constructions</li>
    <li>Research</li>
    <li>Shipments</li>
    <li>Extraction Plants</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If the max buying price for one of these demand components is below market price, mesures will be taken to reduce this demand 
    (industry is levelled down, constructions, researches and shipments are paused and extraction plants stop functioning).
  </p>
  <h4>Production Capacity Prices</h4>
  <p>In the second table, you can set the minimum selling prices for your controllable power facilities. When the
      market price exceeds this set price, any producible capacity with the facility will be sold at market price.</p>
  <h4>Storage Capacity Prices</h4>
  <p>
    In the third table, you can specify both the maximum buying price and the minimum selling price for your storage
    facilities:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Buying Price:</strong> Determines the maximum price you're willing to pay for purchasing electricity to
      charge your storage plants. If the market price is below the set price, electricity will be bought to charge the storage facility.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Selling Price:</strong> Sets the minimum price at which you will sell any capacity producible by your
      storage facility. If the market price exceeds the set price, the storage facility will be discharged and the generated power sold on the market.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="Obligatory_Generation">Obligatory Electricity Generation</h3>
  <p>Obligatory electricity generation includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Non-controllable Renewable Power Facilities:</strong> Generation from these facilities cannot be
      controlled and contributes to the overall electricity output.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Minimal generation of Controllable Facilities:</strong> Due to ramping down constraints, a minimal
      generation from controllable facilities is obligatory.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If surplus electricity from these obligatory sources is not needed domestically, it is sold at a fixed price of
    -5/MWh in the market, coresponding to the cost to dump excess electricity. If it cannot be sold, it will be dumped.
  </p>
  <h3 id="Market_Logic">Market Logic</h3>
  <p>The electricity market operates automatically and follows specific steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Calculate Capacities:</strong> Calculate available generation capacities and demand from all players in
      the market.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Order Capacities:</strong> Organize available capacities and demand in ascending and descending price
      order, respectively.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Find Market Equilibrium:</strong> Determine the point where the supply and demand curves intersect to
      find the market quantity and price (red dot on the <a href="{{ url_for('views.network') }}">market graph</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Transaction:</strong> Capacities below the market price are sold at market price, while demands above
      the market price are bought at market price.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>This automatic process ensures fair transactions based on market supply and demand dynamics.</p>

  <h2 id="Resource_Market">Resource Market</h2>
  <p>The resource market serves as a marketplace for natural resources within Energetica.</p>
  <p>
    To add an offer for a specific quantity of a resource at a chosen price, users can click on the "Put on sale"
    button on the market. This offer will be displayed as a new tile on the page. The amount put up for sale is stored
    in your warehouse but cannot be consumed until sold (visible as "on sale" in the <a href="{{ url_for('overviews.resources') }}">resource graph</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Once another player buys a portion of your offer, you receive the money, and the sold amount is shipped. To remove
    offers from the market, users can repurchase their own resources without losing money, thereby regaining access to
    the resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    If users wish to purchase resources from another player, they can click on the tile of interest, specify the
    desired amount within the available offer, and click "buy". The purchased resources will be shipped to their
    location (refer to <a href="#Resource_shipment">resource shipment</a>).
  </p>
  <h3 id="Resource_shipment">Resource Shipment</h3>
  <p>
    When a certain amount of a natural resource is bought on the market, it is shipped from the seller to the buyer.
    The shipment duration and electricity consumption are calculated based on the following formulas:
  </p>
  <p>
    \(t_{ship} = t_{base} \times dist \times {{ const_data.transport_technology["time factor"] }}^{TT} \) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; \(P_{ship} = \frac{E_{base} \times
    q_{ship} \times {{ const_data.transport_technology["energy factor"] }}^{TT} }{ t_{base} \times {{ const_data.transport_technology["time factor"] }}^{TT} } \)
  </p>
  <p>
    where \(t_{ship}\) is the shipment duration in hours, \(t_{base}\) is the base value of shipment duration : 1.39
    h/tile, \(dist\) is the distance between buyer and seller, \(TT\) is the level of <a href="{{ url_for('views.technology', _anchor='Transport technology') }}">transport technology</a>,
    \(P_{ship}\) is the power consumed for shipping in kW, \(E_{base}\) is the base energy need of shipments : 
    5 kWh/ton/tile and \(q_{ship}\) is the quantity of shipped resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the energy demand of the shipment isn't met, it is paused. Upon arrival, if
    the buyer's warehouse lacks sufficient capacity to store the shipped amount, excess resources will be lost.
  </p>
