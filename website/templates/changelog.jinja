                Emergency generation has been removed. Now, when the electricity generation doesn't match the 
                consumption measures are taken to reduce consumption (pausing constructions, research and shipments, 
                stopping resource extraction and downgrading the industry)
            </li>
            <li class="li_padding">
                Construction and research projects can now be paused and cancelled. Parts of the initial investments 
                will be refunded if a project is cancelled (80% for immediate cancellation and proportionally less after 
                some time has elapsed)

                Introduction of construction and lab workers that can work on one project each. More construction and 
                lab workers can be unlocked with higher levels of 'building technology' and 'laboratory' respectively. 
                The construction and research projects can be reordered. A free worker will start with the first project 
                in the list.

                All power, storage and extraction facilities now have operation and maintenance costs. Renewable and 
                storage facilities have a fixed O&M cost. Controllable and extraction facilities have 20% of their O&M 
                that is fixed and 80% that is variable (depending on the power or resource output). Nuclear facilities 
                have a fixed O&M fraction of 50%.

                <b>In-game Time</b>: One in-game day is not equal to one real day anymore. The in-game time now runs 8 times faster than real time. Additonally, one in-game year is now 72 days long, so one in-game month has 6 days. All times in the game will now be displayed as in-game times and in some cases the equivalent real time might be indicated in parenthesis. For more information, see the <a href="{{ url_for('wiki.render_template_wiki', template_name='game_time') }}">wiki</a>.

                <b>Climate Change</b>: 
                <ul>
                    <li><b>In-game Climate</b>: The server's global average temperature (GAT) is now modelled. It evolves with a seasonal and a random component and is also affected by the CO<sub>2</sub> consentration of the server.</sub></li>
                    <li><b>Climate events</b>: 5 natural events have been introduced that have various negative effects and their probability of occurence increase with unstable climate conditions.</li>
                    <li><b>New Graphs</b>: Two new graphs have been added in the emissions overview page. One shows the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere and the other the global average temperature and the temperature anomaly.</li>
                    <li><b>Climate Risk Score</b>: A new metric has been added on the map that indicates the risk of climate events on the tile.</li>

                <b>New Weather Simulation</b>: Because of the faster in-game time, it is not possible to use real live weather data anymore. The weather is now simulated and is also location dependent. This means that the wind speed and solar iradiance will be different on different tiles but also for different facilities inside a tile. Each solar and wind facility will generate a different amount of power depending on the weather conditions on its location. A visualisation of the weather on the map is planned for the future.

                <b>General Chat</b>: A general chat has been added to the game where all players are added automatically.

                <b>Dashboard Page</b>: The Home page has been renamed to Dashboard. The interactive priority list that appeared on the home page when a player was not in a network has been moved to the network page.

                <b>Daily Quiz</b>: At the bottom of the dashboard page, there is now a question that changes every day. Answering the question correctly will give you 1 XP.

                <b>Map Generation</b>: The resource generation on the map has slightly changed. There should be more high concentrated resources tiles now. The rivers now flow from the inland to the sea (considering the map is an island).
