        <ul>
            <li class="li_padding">
                Emergency generation has been removed. Now, when the electricity generation doesn't match the 
                consumption measures are taken to reduce consumption (pausing constructions, research and shipments, 
                stopping resource extraction and downgrading the industry)
            </li>
            <li class="li_padding">
                Construction and research projects can now be paused and cancelled. Parts of the initial investments 
                will be refunded if a project is cancelled (80% for immediate cancellation and proportionally less after 
                some time has elapsed)
            </li>
            <li class="li_padding">
                Introduction of construction and lab workers that can work on one project each. More construction and 
                lab workers can be unlocked with higher levels of 'building technology' and 'laboratory' respectively. 
                The construction and research projects can be reordered. A free worker will start with the first project 
                in the list.
            </li>
            <li class="li_padding">
                New home page with current weather conditions, constructions and research projects under way and order 
                of priority of facilites (see wiki for more details).
            </li>
            <li class="li_padding">
                Facilities (power, storage and extraction) now have lifetimes and will be decommissioned automatically 
                after this time has passed. The cost of decomissioning is 20% of the current price of this facility.
            </li>
            <li class="li_padding">
                All power, storage and extraction facilities now have operation and maintenance costs. Renewable and 
                storage facilites have a fixed O&M cost. Controllable and extraction facilites have 20% of their O&M 
                that is fixed and 80% that is variable (depending on the power or resource output). Nuclear facilities 
                have a fixed O&M fraction of 50%.
            </li>
            <li class="li_padding">
                Modeling of knowledge spillover for technology research. The price of research gets 8% cheaper and 
                faster to research for each other player that already researched it on the server.
            </li>
            <li class="li_padding">SCP (self consumption priority) has been removed in the networks.</li>
