    Once a player unlocks the climate change advancement (Research chemistry lvl 1), they will have acess to the page 
    <a href="{{ url_for('overviews.emissions') }}">Emissions</a> in the production overviews. There they will see the 
    servers CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, the server's climate and their personal emissions.

  <h2 id="co2_emissions">CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions</h2>
  <p>
    Sources of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are constructions and all facilities that consume fuel plus the steam engine (controllable 
    facilities). Aditionally, the functional facility <a href="{{ url_for('wiki.render_template_wiki', template_name='functional_facilities', _anchor='Carbon_Capture') }}">Carbon Capture</a>
    can absorb CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere and store it. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The atmosphere is shared between all players and the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by all players will increase the server's CO<sub>2</sub> concentration.
    The reference value for the server's "natural" CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is <span class="hover_info">300 ppm
    <span class="popup_info small">parts per million</span></span> wich corresponds to a base value of 40 Mt of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere.
  </p>

  <h2 id="climate">Climate</h2>
  <p>
    The server's climate is represented by the global average temperature (GAT). The GAT has a natural seasonal variation 
    due to the asymetric distribution of land and water on the planet. Due to the important role of CO<sub>2</sub> in the
    greenhouse effect, the server's climate will be affected by the server's CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The so called 
    <i>global temperature anomaly</i> is the difference between the server's GAT and the reference GAT. This temperature 
    anomaly has a random component due to natural climate variability and a deterministic component proportional to the 
    servers CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. The atmosphere will warm up by one degree for every <span class="hover_info">100 ppm
    <span class="popup_info small">parts per million</span></span> of additional CO<sub>2</sub> concentration with some 
    delay.
  </p>

  <h2 id="climate_events">Climate Events</h2>
  <p>
    Climate events have a low chance of occuring naturally every game tick however, the probability of their occurence 
    increases with climate change. Climate events are always negative and can have a wide range of consequences. 
  </p>
  <p>
    All tiles do not have the same risk of being affected by a climate event. A climate risk score is visible in the 
    <a href="/map_view">Map</a> that indicates the probaility and the severity of the climate events in each tile.
  </p>

  <h3 id="heatwave">Heatwave</h3>

  <p>
    Heatwaves have a higher chance of occuring with higher global temperatures. They have a big impact on the population, 
    especially the elderly and the sick. Heatwaves can also have a negative impact on battery storage technologies and 
    can cause overheating and in some cases permanent damage.

    When a wildfire occurs, the tile it will affect (with it's neigbours) is chosen randomly following a normal 
    distribution around the equator. This means that the risk is higher in tiles near the equator and lower in
    tiles near the poles. The following figure shows the probability distribution overlayed on the map.

  <h3 id="flood">Flood</h3>

  <p>
    Floods can only occur in tiles with a hydro potential higher than 20% and have a higher chance of occuring with 
    higher global temperatures anomaly. They can damage facilities near rivers and have a chance of cause an important 
    reduction of the industries productivity. Floods might destroy water dams and if this happens, the flood will be 
    propagated to the downstream tiles.

    The huricane is the most destructive climate event. It can ocurr anywhere on the map and will affect a large area.
