  <h2>Welcome to Energetica</h2>
  <p>
    As a player, you take on the role of managing the electricity generation of your city or country. 
    Starting with basic technology like a rudimentary steam engine, you'll progress towards more advanced options such 
    as photovoltaics and nuclear reactors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your continuous vigilance over production is essential to ensure a consistent and adequate supply of electricity to 
    support various energy needs. Collaborating with other players to establish a network for trading electricity 
    and advancing technological developments is crucial.
  </p>
  <p>
    Effective management of fossil fuels and careful monitoring of emissions are imperative, as consequences may arise 
    from negligence in these areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    Energetica is a long-term game lasting multiple months. Remember to log in regularly to check progress and make 
    new decisions to shape the energy landscape of your community!
