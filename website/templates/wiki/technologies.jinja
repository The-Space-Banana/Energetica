    Technological advancements in Energetica are made possible through research conducted at the 
    <a href="{{ url_for('wiki.render_template_wiki', template_name='functional_facilities', _anchor='The_Laboratory') }}">laboratory</a>. 
    These technologies are needed to unlock more advanced facilities and offer improvements to specific aspects of your
    production within the game. Each technology has a unique effect tailored to a particular set of facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Researching technologies involves electricity consumption without direct CO2 emissions. The technology research is 
    carried out by the lab workers and it follows the same principle as the constructions with the construction workers 
    (<a href="{{ url_for('wiki.render_template_wiki', template_name='power_facilities', _anchor='Construction_of_a_Plant') }}">Construction of a Facility</a>). 
    Consecutive upgrades of the same technology are not parallelizable.
